\section{Atomic mode}
One of the less mentioned things Helm can do is that it can atomically deploy things to a cluster.

What does atomically mean here?
Specifically it means that an application will (if the Helm chart was configured correctly) never let the application get stuck in a broken state on upgrades.

To do that it provides the \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{--atomic} flag usable on \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{helm upgrade}.
When the flag is provided Helm will wait until the application entered a successful state where all pods report being ready in \Gls{k8s}.
If this is not achieved Helm will automatically roll back to the last successful deployment version.
It also ensures that the old application still is running while trying this by utilizing the way Deployments in \Gls{k8s} work.
A deployment with rolling update will spawn a new pod, wait for it to get into the \enquote{Ready} state on the cluster and only then stop the old pod.
The default timeout for Helm's atomic deployment is at 5m.
It is generally a good idea to use this however tools like argocd generally do not expose this mode to the users.

\section{Listing deployments and rollback of deployments}
Helm automatically records a list of deployments done to each Helm chart.
This allows for 2 great things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Your application is deployed in a way which can be audited
  \item Your application can be rolled back easily to a previous state even if you do not know the values anymore
\end{enumerate}

To view the history of a specific Helm chart deployment you can use \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{helm history <release_name> -n <namespace>}.
Note however that unless you add the `--max` flag only the last 256 revisions will be displayed.

When you end up in a broken deployment or need to downgrade the application version this information can be coupled with \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{helm rollback}.
You can either use \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{helm rollback <release_name>} to roll back to the previous revision or \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{helm rollback <release_name> <revision>} to rollback to a specific revision.

Important to note is that this does not handle database migrations.

\section{Linting}
Apart from operational commands Helm also allows you to lint a package.
To do that there is the \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{helm lint <PATH>} subcommand available which provides a relatively small linter for the Helm chart.
It is generally a good idea to use this.
You can find more information on this at \url{https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_lint/}.
